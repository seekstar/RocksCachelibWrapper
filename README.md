# RocksCachelibWrapper

A concrete implementation of rocksdb::SecondaryCache using CacheLib.

The code is copied from [facebook's open sourced implementation of CacheLib-based SecondaryCache](https://github.com/facebook/CacheLib/tree/main/cachelib/adaptor/rocks_secondary_cache) with internally used code removed so that it can compile (related issue: facebook/CacheLib#278).
